# built_python
Road map for learning python for those in the built environment. Includes suggested reading for technical audiences, links, relevant projects, and general tips (tba). Currently more general, will add specifics relevant to AEC as time permits.


## Suggested repositories
[Python reference](https://github.com/rasbt/python_reference)

General reference and includes Python notebooks (IPython nb) which I'd call a unique cross between MathCAD and programming. These are widely used in the scientific community as "interactive" papers where you can run code within a paper.

[Awesome python](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python) 

There are a few "awesome" lists on github for every flavor of programming language. Check out the sections on  Specific Formats Processing (i.e.Python and Microsoft Office products) as well as Science (for numpy and scipy as a replacement for Matlab)

[Python by example](https://github.com/sahands/python-by-example)

Just a blog with a few tips and tricks

## Json 
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON)

Human readable "lightweight" way of storing data as key value pairs. Plays well with Python and most programming languages.
